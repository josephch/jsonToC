### Prompt
```
C++ program to convert a json keys to a  C  structure to hold  the json using cjson library. print the structure to a file provided as input.
write the inner json first so that it can be referenced in the outer structure.
For string key, instead of char pointer,  use char array .  #define the size of the value as array size, then use it as the size of the char array. Use capital letters for the #define names. Also gather all #defines to the beginning of the file.
Also, generate code to generate  c code to parse similar json and populate  structure object.
```
